Hi there👋,

👀 I am a junior Software Developer with 2 years of experience.
I am experienced in C#, CSS, .NET framework, Python and Javascript.

🌱 I am currently trying to improve my existing skills and learn new ones, such as REACT and Node.JS.

⚡In my space time I watch anime, read manga and webnovels, play video games, play badminton and try to relearn guitar.
